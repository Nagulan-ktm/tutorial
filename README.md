## 📘 Fibonacci Sequence Generator

This project is a simple Python script that prints the Fibonacci sequence using basic variable manipulation and a loop.

### 📂 File Structure

tutorial/
├── Code.py
└── README.md

### 🧾 Description

The script `Code.py` generates and prints the first 12 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence (starting from 0 and 1). The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

### 📌 How It Works

1. Starts with two numbers: `0` and `1`
2. Prints the initial two numbers
3. Uses a `for` loop to calculate the next 10 Fibonacci numbers
4. Prints each number in the sequence as it is generated

### 💡 Example Output

0
1
1
2
3
5
8
13
21
34
55
89

### ▶️ How to Run
